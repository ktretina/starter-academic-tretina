I believe in bringing together ideas from disparate realms of thought to uncover beauty and inspiration in the life around me. The way that I do that is by distilling insights from large datasets into simple messages that have thoughtful designs and are customized for their audiences. I just happen to be trained in genomics, immunology, and microbiology.
