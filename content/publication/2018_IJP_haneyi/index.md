abstract: A novel apicomplexan parasite was serendipitously discovered in horses at the United States - Mexico
  border. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rDNA showed the erythrocyte-infective parasite to be related
  to, but distinct from, Theileria spp. in Africa, the most similar taxa being Theileria spp. from waterbuck and
  mountain zebra. The degree of sequence variability observed at the 18S rDNA locus also suggests the
  likely existence of additional cryptic species. Among described species, the genome of this novel equid
  Theileria parasite is most similar to that of Theileria equi, also a pathogen of horses. The estimated divergence
  time between the new Theileria sp. and T. equi, based on genomic sequence data, is greater than 33
  million years. Average protein sequence divergence between them, at 23%, is greater than that of Theileria
  parva and Theileria annulata proteins, which is 18%. The latter two represent highly virulent Theileria spp.
  of domestic cattle, as well as of African and Asian wild buffalo, respectively, which differ markedly in
  pathology, host cell tropism, tick vector and geographical distribution. The extent of genome-wide
  sequence divergence, as well as significant morphological differences, relative to T. equi justify the                classification of Theileria sp. as a new taxon. Despite the overall genomic divergence, the nine member equi
  merozoite antigen (EMA) superfamily, previously found as a multigene family only in T. equi, is also present
  in the novel parasite. Practically, significant sequence divergence in antigenic loci resulted in this
  undescribed Theileria sp. not being detectable using currently available diagnostic tests. Discovery of this
  novel species infective to equids highlights exceptional diversity within the genus Theileria, a finding with
  serious implications for apicomplexan parasite surveillance.
