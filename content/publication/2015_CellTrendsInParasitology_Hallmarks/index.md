abstract: The genus Theileria includes tick-transmitted apicomplexan
  parasites of ruminants with substantial economic
  impact in endemic countries. Some species, including
  Theileria parva and Theileria annulata, infect leukocytes
  where they induce phenotypes that are shared with
  some cancers, most notably immortalization, hyperproliferation,
  and dissemination. Despite considerable research
  into the affected host signaling pathways, the
  parasite proteins directly responsible for these host
  phenotypes remain unknown. In this review, we outline
  current knowledge on the manipulation of host cells
  by transformation-inducing Theileria, and we propose
  that comparisons between cancer biology and host-
  Theileria interactions can reveal chemotherapeutic
  targets against Theileria-induced pathogenesis based
  on cancer treatment approaches.
