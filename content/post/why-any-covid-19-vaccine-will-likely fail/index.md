With the announcement of early data indicating that vaccines from [Moderna](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201116005608/en/Moderna%E2%80%99s-COVID-19-Vaccine-Candidate-Meets-its-Primary-Efficacy-Endpoint-in-the-First-Interim-Analysis-of-the-Phase-3-COVE-Study) [\[1]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/uISc), as well as from [Pfizer and BioNTech](https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/) [\[2]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/SPjn) are more effective than most experts predicted, is there reason to be cautiously optimistic? Both vaccines were selected for [US Operation Warp Speed](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abd1719) [\[3]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/lyMw) and are expected to become the first vaccines licensed for human use, are well supported by [previous scientific studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-00434-6#Sec1) and comprehensive clinical trials [\[4]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/DEsP) , and fall within a [vaccine development landscape](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tung_Le53/publication/340535627_The_COVID-19_vaccine_development_landscape/links/5ead65c5a6fdcc7050a1c089/The-COVID-19-vaccine-development-landscape.pdf) [\[5]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/MfAX) that is well touted to be a promising source of an effective vaccine, so why could they fail?



**Many may expect that the vaccine will provide sterilizing immunity to infection.**

Failure is the result of unmet expectations, and there is reason to believe that experts have very high expectations for [these COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/11/16/moderna-coronavirus-vaccines-expectations) [\[6]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/7Fo3)[\[7]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/bEni). In an era when we have common vaccines that provide decades of [protection](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/how-long-do-vaccines-last-surprising-answers-may-help-protect-people-longer) [\[8]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/uRRc)(e.g. Tetanus, Diphtheria, Rubella, Measles, etc.), the bar is set very high. Since the 18th century, vaccines have been used to eradicate the diseases of smallpox and rinderpest, nearly eradicated polio, and the end of measles is in sight. Many scientists think that vaccines are the best thing to happen to human global public health after clean water and [sanitation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4024226/) [\[9]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/WQbV). However, even as our knowledge of immunity to some infections is far more insightful than at any point in the history of mankind, the gap between what we know about COVID-19 and what we think we know may be widening.

Some common vaccines protect against viral infection very effectively. There is a vaccine against Hepatitis A (Hep A), a viral liver disease, that can provide >90% protection against symptomatic disease as well as asymptomatic infections [\[10]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/55Pk). The vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) provides essentially 100% protection against infection [\[11]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/Hjvb). This is called “sterilizing immunity”, which could decrease with age after a few decades, but can be maintained to some extent via the adaptive immune system [\[12]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/pV5m). 

However, the HPV vaccine is exceptional. Many vaccines are primarily intended to prevent disease and do not necessarily protect against infection or transmission nearly as efficiently. According to the CDC, influenza vaccine effectiveness (verified disease confirmed after a visit to the doctor or hospital) in the last fifteen flu seasons has ranged from 10% in the 2004-2005 season to 60% in the 2010-2011 [season](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/past-seasons-estimates.html) [\[13]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/Gwz4). Flu vaccines are recommended on an annual basis because the duration and strength of immunity plummets on a yearly [timescale](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/acip/immunogenicity.htm#Duration) [\[14]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/1gHJ). In the case of an acellular pertussis vaccine, vaccinated individuals had a significantly shorter duration of chronic cough than controls [\[15,16]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/U3gy+wXXY). Vaccination has also been shown to lessen disease for varicella and rotavirus infections [\[17,18]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/oZDH+2p94). There are many [hopes](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/07/covid-19-vaccine-reality-check/614566/) [\[19]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/DdxI), dreams and [economic](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-open-mostly-higher-on-vaccine-optimism-2020-07-20) [\[20]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/kobt) futures riding on the discovery of an effective COVID-19 vaccine. While early data is purported to indicate highly efficient short-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, there has not yet been enough time passed to quantify how long that protection endures. 



**The social acceptance rate of any COVID-19 vaccine may not be enough.**

Worldwide, the uptake of vaccines has improved dramatically over the past few decades. Vaccines are perhaps the cheapest and most effective way to prevent infections, and most surveyed people think that vaccination is [important](https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination) [\[21]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/OILs) and that they would very likely take a COVID-19 vaccine should one become available to them [\[22]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/nysJ), but that consensus might not be large enough in the United [States](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/28/health/fauci-coronavirus-vaccine-contact-tracing-aspen/index.html) [\[23–26]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/m8hr+sL8a+TJDl+dSiN). 

While these vaccines have passed the 50% efficacy standard set by the FDA for regulatory [approval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdmaU2-C_wE&feature=youtu.be), is an >90% effective vaccine enough for public opinion? Surveys suggest that somewhere around [50](https://apnews.com/dacdc8bc428dd4df6511bfa259cfec44)-[72](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/05/21/most-americans-expect-a-covid-19-vaccine-within-a-year-72-say-they-would-get-vaccinated/)% [\[27,28]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/014R+U5LU) of people in the U.S. would get a COVID-19 vaccine, should it become available, with physician advice playing the largest role in their [decision](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/helping-us-healthcare-stakeholders-understand-the-human-side-of-the-covid-19-crisis) [\[29]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/Lgg3). In fact, most adults expect a treatment or cure before the end of the year, and a [vaccine](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/05/21/most-americans-expect-a-covid-19-vaccine-within-a-year-72-say-they-would-get-vaccinated/) in 2020 [\[28]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/U5LU), or some time in [2021](https://apnews.com/dacdc8bc428dd4df6511bfa259cfec44) [\[27]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/014R). This is approximately the same range of coverage that has been estimated to be required for herd [immunity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320301709) ([55-82%](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article)) [\[30]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/dzDG)[\[31]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/31zu), meaning that small changes in public opinion (e.g. due to [politicization](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/29/both-republicans-and-democrats-cite-masks-as-a-negative-effect-of-covid-19-but-for-very-different-reasons/)[\[32]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/Uswd)) about any potential vaccine could have important implications for how effective that vaccine is in practice. 



**“It Ain't What You Do It's the Way That You Do It” -- Bananarama and Fun Boy Three.**

There is often a gap between the insights of people who generate analysis and those who use them [\[33]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/3cD3), and the insights of public health experts and the general public might be no different. Just like the vaccine itself, there are too many variables right now to predict whether the timing and delivery of the news about a potential vaccine is effectively inoculating the minds of Americans against the doubt and [distrust](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-anti-vaccine.html) [\[34]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/QxZa) that is so prominent against the government and pharmaceutical [companies](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/) [\[35]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/RR4Q). Humans don’t make decisions well if they are given multiple [choices](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17661-z) [\[36]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/tCpl), which is important when it might take multiple vaccines to get us back to near-normality. There are many technical hurdles that vaccine producers have yet to overcome with the scaling of new technologies (i.e. RNA-based [designs](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccines-manufactu/vaccine-makers-face-biggest-medical-manufacturing-challenge-in-history-idUSKBN23W1ND) [\[37]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/SSLO)), and the further optimization of vaccine design (e.g. viral target, delivery route, timing, [dose](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-20/double-shot-covid-vaccine-tests-raise-new-pandemic-challenge), etc.) [\[38]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/xPWs) to provide the long-lasting protection needed for herd immunity and the eradication of COVID-19.

*The current social climate and scientific data make the outcome of any vaccination campaign in the U.S. very difficult to predict.* 

With the pandemic being often called “uncertain times” [\[35,39]](https://paperpile.com/c/bBwfPJ/RR4Q+OyFt), Americans are discovering, to some extent, a peek into the life of a scientist. Variations in the timing of states reopening, kids returning to schools, enforcement of PPE requirements, and the upcoming vaccine rollouts are all experiments with uncertain outcomes. It’s important for us to now examine our biases and determine, before the heat of the moment, how we are going to interpret the data before it arrives.
