Michael Price, a reporter for Science magazine, wrote a piece about the pressures that academic trainees are facing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and he used me as a reference for Yale University:

You can read the full quote here:


"In the early days of the outbreak, some PIs at Yale University advised their lab employees to go into the lab as little as possible, while others encouraged more or less business as usual, says Kyle Tretina, a postdoc at the university who studies host-pathogen genomics. At that point, the university had announced a stated aim "to keep our campus infrastructure in place for continuity of research," while also asking faculty and lab directors to encourage their subordinates to work from home when feasible. But on 18 March, Yale announced that labs should shut down all nonessential research activity by the end of the week. Now, "it sounds like everyone is finally getting on board," says Tretina.

In the midst of all this, many grad students and postdocs have wanted to continue their research. "I haven't heard of any instances at Yale where a PI was saying, 'Get in the lab' to someone who didn't want to be in the lab," he says. "They're mostly just scrambling, trying to make sure nothing's lost" so that they don't set back their academic goals or miss out on large chunks of their postdoc training.

Even so, it can be difficult to tell whether such willingness is borne of a personal desire to work on research projects or a perceived need to obey one's superiors, Tretina admits. Graduate students in particular are in a vulnerable position, he notes, as they often don't feel like they can contradict their PI.""
