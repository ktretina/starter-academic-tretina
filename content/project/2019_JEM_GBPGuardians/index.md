abstract: Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) have recently emerged as central orchestrators of immunity to infection,  inflammation,and neoplastic diseases. Within numerous host cell types, these IFN-induced GTPases assemble into large  nanomachines that execute distinct host defense activities against a wide variety of microbial pathogens. In          addition, GBPs customize inflammasome responses to bacterial infection and sepsis, where they act as critical         rheostats to amplify innate immunity and regulate tissue damage. Similar functions are becoming evident for metabolic inflammatory syndromes and cancer, further underscoring the importance of GBPs within infectious as well as altered    homeostatic settings. A better understanding of the basic biology of these IFN-induced GTPases could thus benefit     clinical approaches to a wide spectrum of important human diseases.
