abstract: East Coast fever is a lymphoproliferative disease caused by the tick-borne protozoan parasite Theileria
  parva. The sporozoite stage of this parasite, harboured and released from the salivary glands of the tick
  Rhipicephalus appendiculatus during feeding, invades and establishes infection in bovine lymphocytes.
  Blocking this initial stage of invasion presents a promising vaccine strategy for control of East Coast fever
  and can in part be achieved by targeting the major sporozoite surface protein p67. To support research on
  the biology of T. parva and the identification of additional candidate vaccine antigens, we report on the
  sporozoite proteome as defined by LC - MS/MS analysis. In total, 4,780 proteins were identified in an
  enriched preparation of sporozoites. Of these, 2,007 were identified as T. parva proteins, representing
  close to 50% of the total predicted parasite proteome. The remaining 2,773 proteins were derived from
  the tick vector. The identified sporozoite proteins include a set of known T. parva antigens targeted by
  antibodies and cytotoxic T cells from cattle that are immune to East Coast fever. We also identified proteins
  predicted to be orthologs of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite surface molecules and invasion organelle
  proteins, and proteins that may contribute to the phenomenon of bovine lymphocyte transformation. Overall, these data      establish a protein expression profile of T. parva sporozoites as an
  important starting point for further study of a parasitic species which has considerable agricultural
  impact.
