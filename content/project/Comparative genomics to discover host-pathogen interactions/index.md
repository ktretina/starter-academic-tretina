   In order to evade host defenses and adapt to different host niches, intracellular pathogens have evolved mechanisms to alter host signaling pathways. A monophyletic clade of eukaryotic parasites in the genus Theileria infects bovine leukocytes and induces cancer-like phenotypes in the host cell (PMID 25951781), including hyper-proliferation, which are believed to be important drivers of host pathology. By combining comparative genomics approaches with protein-protein interaction screens, we are uncovering the genes involved in Theileria-host interactions as well as novel potential chemotherapeutic targets for disease.
