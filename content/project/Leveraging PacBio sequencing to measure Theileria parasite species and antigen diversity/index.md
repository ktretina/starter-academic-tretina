   The apicomplexan parasite Theileria parva causes an acute and ultimately deadly disease in susceptible domestic cattle. While an an immunization protocol by infection and treatment can provide some immunological protection, this protection is partially strain-specific, and evaluation of protection is complicated by co-infection of multiple closely related Theileria parasites of buffalo origin. In order to uncover the natural diversity of Theileria parasite species, as well as their antigenic diversity, we are sequencing genes from samples collected on a farm in Naivasha, Kenya with a Pacific Biosciences sequencing platform and are currently characterizing them.
