   Annotation of intracellular parsite genomes continues to be a significant challenge for researchers because of limitations in the quantity and quality of the data being used, as well as the biological complexity of gene regulation in these species. We have recently published the first RNAs-seq dataset for the apicomplexan parasite Theileria parva (PMID 26896950), which causes a deadly disease in cattle in sub-Saharan African countries, and are using it to update the strutural and functional annotation of genes across the entire T. parva genome. This process has led to insights into the biology of this parasite and uncovered potential new chemotherapeutic targets, and is available at http://jbrowse.igs.umaryland.edu/t_parva.
