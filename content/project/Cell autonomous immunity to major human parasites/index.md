   The mammalian immune system has evolved sophisticated strategies to combat or tolerate parasite infection. In addition, however, cells outside of classical immune system have also emerged as important and sometimes obligate participants in helping restrict the replication of major human pathogens. This "extended" arm of the immune system remains poorly characterized in response to non-viral pathogens and represents a greatly underappreciated aspect of mammalian host defense. It is also likely to reveal novel resistance mechanisms since most non-immune lineages lack the armamentarium synonymous with activated immune cells deployed against bacterial, fungal and typically parasitic infections. This study begins to probe unchartered territory by examining the host response to intracellular apicomplexan parasites in non-immune cells across large-scale functional landscapes. A critical instructive signal for mobilizing anti-parasite immunity is the type II cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN), which arguably represents the most potent agonist for conferring this activity on an equimolar basis in a wide variety of human cell types. Genome-wide and sub-genomic CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function libraries together with computational analyses are being enlisted to delineate the spectrum of IFN-dependent immunity to medically significant human parasites, which replicates within unique intracellular niches in different human cell types and has significant effects on human health worldwide. Given the lack of systems-based knowledge about the way in which cells protect themselves against these parasites, this work could identify new host-directed chemotherapeutic targets and change our understanding of anti-parasite immunity in terms of the modular circuitry involved.
