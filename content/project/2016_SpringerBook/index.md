abstract: In the last decade, the rise of affordable high-throughput sequencing technologies has led to rapid advances   across the biological sciences. At the time of writing, annotated reference genomes are available for most clades of   eukaryotic pathogens. Over 550 genomes, including unannotated sequences, are available in total. This has
  greatly facilitated studies in many areas of parasitology. In addition, the volume of
  functional genomics data, including analysis of differential transcription and DNAprotein
  interactions, has increased exponentially. With this unprecedented increase
  in publicly available data, tools to search and compare datasets are becoming ever
  more important. A number of database resources are available, and access to these
  has become fundamental for a majority of research groups. This chapter discusses
  the current state of genomics research for a number of eukaryotic parasites, addressing
  the genome and functional genomics resources available and highlighting functionally
  important or unique aspects of the genome for each group. Publicly
  accessible database resources pertaining to eukaryotic parasites are also discussed.
