As part of a new relationship with Early Charm Ventures, LLC (Baltimore, MD), I am starting to do consulting work, performing comprehensive industry/company analysis on new ventures, specializing in technologies that use next generation sequencing and sequence-based analysis. This includes looking at company financials, identiying key operating metrics, determining potential exogenous risks and cost drivers to inform company investment decisions.
