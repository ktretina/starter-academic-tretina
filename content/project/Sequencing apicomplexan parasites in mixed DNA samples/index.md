   The apicomplexan parasite Theileria parva is an economically important intracellular parasite of cattle in sub-Saharan African countries. A live vaccine consisting of three strains of parasites is effective against cattle-transmissible T. parva, but not strains of buffalo origin. However, the genomic differences between these parasites are not known and it is technically difficult to sequence genomes from field samples due to significant host DNA contamination. We are currently developing methods to that allows us to generate nearly complete genomes from DNA samples of infected bovine cells to provide a better picture of the genome-wide Theileria diversity that contributes to host evasion and host switching.
