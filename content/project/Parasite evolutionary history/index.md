   Species in the phylum Apicomplexa cause disease in humans and infect a variety of mammals and other vertebrates. The estimated ages for the divergence of these parasites often differ by over an order of magnitude, making reliable estimation of the rate of evolution of disease-related traits difficult. We are developing novel statistical approaches to dating the relative ages of evolutionary lineages in this phylum to give insight into the prevalence of host-switching on an evolutionary scale, and provide solid timeframes for the evolution of these parasites.
